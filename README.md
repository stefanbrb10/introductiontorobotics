# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)
Here is the space for all my work in the Intoduction to Robotics class, taken by me in the 3rd year of my Computer Engineering degree. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

My goal for the upcoming work is to be able to tell people I know how to build something that you can see without a screen.

## Homework 1 - Light an RGB LED using separate potentiometers
This homework focuses on using three potentiometers for each color channel (red, green and blue). The values from the potentiometers are adapted to ouput each color's intensity on the LED.
After finishing this task i feel like i understood the basics of the field: the breadboard, Analog vs Digital, the Arduino IDE, etc.
<br> <br>
Components:
  - 1x RGB LED
  - 3x Pontentiometers
  - Arduino UNO
  - Breadboard
  - 3x 330 Ohm resistors
  - Wires

The final hardware work is captured on the picture below and on [this video link](https://www.youtube.com/), and the code can be found on the repository.
